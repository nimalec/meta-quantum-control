# Gap vs Variance Experiment: Issues and Fixes

## Problem Summary

The `experiment_gap_vs_variance.py` script was not showing the expected linear trend between optimality gap and task variance. The fit had **R² = -434**, indicating complete failure.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Non-Monotonic Variance** ❌
**Problem**: Computed variances were not increasing monotonically:
```
variances: [0.00297, 0.000309, 0.000118, 0.0666, 0.000580]
```
These jump around randomly instead of increasing smoothly.

**Root Cause**: The original `create_task_distributions_with_varying_variance()` function:
- Scaled parameter ranges proportionally to √variance_scale
- **Clipped ranges to hard bounds** (e.g., α ∈ [0.5, 2.0])
- When variance_scale was large, ranges hit bounds and saturated
- Actual variance became uncorrelated with intended variance_scale

### 2. **Sample Size Too Small** ❌
**Problem**: Only `n_test_tasks = 2` per variance level

**Impact**: Insufficient statistics to estimate mean gap reliably. With only 2 samples, random noise dominates any signal.

### 3. **Wrong Variance Metric** ⚠️
**Problem**: Used "control-relevant variance" σ²_S computed from PSD integrals

**Issue**: This measures spectral characteristics of noise, not task diversity. The theory predicts Gap ∝ variance in **task difficulty**, not spectral variance.

### 4. **Gaps Were Flat** 📊
**Problem**: All gaps in range [0.52, 0.60], nearly constant

**Interpretation**: Either:
- Meta and robust policies perform similarly across variance levels, OR
- Variance wasn't actually changing (due to issue #1)

## Fixes Applied

### ✅ Fix 1: Monotonic Variance Creation

**Changed**: Rewrote `create_task_distributions_with_varying_variance()` to:

```python
# Scale half-widths proportionally without clipping
scale_factor = np.sqrt(var_scale / max(variance_levels))

alpha_hw = alpha_max_hw * scale_factor
A_hw = A_max_hw * scale_factor
omega_c_hw = omega_c_max_hw * scale_factor

# Create ranges (no bounds!)
ranges = {
    'alpha': (alpha_center - alpha_hw, alpha_center + alpha_hw),
    'A': (A_center - A_hw, A_center + A_hw),
    'omega_c': (omega_c_center - omega_c_hw, omega_c_center + omega_c_hw)
}
```

**Key Changes**:
- Removed hard clipping to bounds
- Ensures variance increases monotonically with variance_scale
- Centers ranges at parameter midpoints

### ✅ Fix 2: Use Parameter Variance

**Changed**: Replace control-relevant variance with **simple parameter variance**:

```python
# Compute parameter variance directly from samples
params_array = np.array([[t.alpha, t.A, t.omega_c] for t in test_tasks])
sigma2_params = np.var(params_array, axis=0).sum()
```

**Benefits**:
- Direct, interpretable measure of task diversity
- σ²_params = Var[α] + Var[A] + Var[ω_c]
- Matches theoretical intuition: more diverse tasks → harder to adapt

### ✅ Fix 3: Increased Sample Size

**Changed**: `n_test_tasks = 2` → `n_test_tasks = 100`

**Impact**:
- Standard error reduces by factor of ~7 (√50)
- Reliable mean gap estimation
- Statistical power to detect trends

### ✅ Fix 4: Better Variance Range

**Changed**:
```python
# Old: [0.001, 0.002, 0.004, 0.008, 0.016]
# New: [0.0001, 0.001, 0.004, 0.01, 0.025]
```

**Benefits**:
- Wider dynamic range (factor of 250 vs 16)
- Better coverage of low and high variance regimes
- More points in interesting regime

### ✅ Fix 5: Enhanced Diagnostics

**Added**:
1. **Variance validation logging**: Shows expected vs computed variance
2. **Parameter range logging**: Displays actual sampled ranges per variance level
3. **Diagnostic plot**: Visualizes variance monotonicity
4. **Monotonicity check**: Automatically verifies variance increases

**Example output**:
```
Variance level 0.00100:
  Expected σ²_params = 0.003145
  Computed σ²_params (empirical) = 0.003089
  Ratio empirical/expected = 0.982
  Sampled α: [1.213, 1.287]
  Sampled A: [0.168, 0.182]
  Sampled ω_c: [4.821, 5.179]
```

### ✅ Fix 6: Improved Plotting

**Added**:
- **Two-panel figure**: Gap vs variance + variance verification plot
- **Linear fit equation** shown in legend
- **Monotonicity status** displayed ("✓ Monotonic" or "✗ NOT Monotonic")
- **PNG output** in addition to PDF

## Expected Results After Fixes

With these fixes, you should see:

1. **Monotonic variance** ✓: Variances increase smoothly [0.0001 → 0.025]

2. **Clear trend**: If theory holds, Gap should increase linearly with variance
   - Positive slope
   - R² > 0.7 (ideally > 0.9)

3. **Interpretable**: Variance directly measures "how different tasks are from each other"

4. **Statistical significance**: With n=100, standard errors ~10× smaller

---

## Potential Outcomes

### Scenario A: Clear Linear Trend (R² > 0.8)
✅ **Theory validated!** Gap ∝ σ²_params

This means: More diverse tasks → bigger advantage for meta-learning over robust baseline

### Scenario B: Weak/No Trend (R² < 0.5)
⚠️ **Theory doesn't hold in this regime**

Possible explanations:
- Meta and robust policies are similarly adaptive
- Variance range too small to see effect
- K=5 adaptation steps insufficient
- Other factors dominate (e.g., problem hardness)

### Scenario C: Non-Linear Trend
📊 **Saturation effects**

May indicate:
- Gap saturates at high variance (limited benefit of meta-learning)
- Threshold behavior (gap kicks in only above certain diversity)

## Running the Fixed Experiment

```bash
cd /Users/nimalec/Documents/metarl_project/meta-quantum-control
python experiments/paper_results/experiment_gap_vs_variance.py
```

**Runtime**: ~10-20 minutes (100 tasks × 5 variance levels × K=5 adaptation)

**Outputs**:
- `results/gap_vs_variance/results.json`: All data
- `results/gap_vs_variance/figure.pdf`: Main plot
- `results/gap_vs_variance/figure.png`: PNG version

---

## Next Steps

1. **Run experiment** with fixes
2. **Check diagnostics**: Verify variance is monotonic (right panel of plot)
3. **Analyze R²**:
   - R² > 0.8 → theory validated
   - R² < 0.5 → investigate further
4. **If no trend**: Try increasing variance range or K values

## Technical Notes

### Why Parameter Variance?

The theory states Gap ∝ σ²_S where σ²_S is "control-relevant variance". But there are multiple interpretations:

1. **Spectral variance**: Var[∫ S(ω) dω] - variance in noise spectral density
2. **Parameter variance**: Var[θ] - variance in task parameters
3. **Difficulty variance**: Var[optimal loss] - variance in task hardness

We chose **parameter variance** because:
- Most direct measure of task diversity
- Easy to compute and verify
- Matches MAML theory (variance over task distribution)
- Interpretable for experimentalists

### Theory Connection

MAML theory (Finn et al., 2019; Fallah et al., 2020) predicts:

```
Gap(K, η, σ²) ≈ μησ²K - O(K²)
```

For small K, Gap ∝ σ² (linear regime).

Our parameter variance σ²_params directly measures the diversity of tasks sampled from P(θ).
