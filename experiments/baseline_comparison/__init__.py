Baseline Comparison Module

This module provides tools for comparing meta-learned policies against
non-adaptive baselines:
- Meta K=0: Meta-initialization without adaptation
- Average Task: Policy trained on mean task
- Meta K>0: Meta-learning with adaptation

Usage:
    from baseline_comparison import train_average_task, evaluate_baselines
